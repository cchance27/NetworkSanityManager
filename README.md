# Network Sanity Manager

This project is designed to automate the checking of network devices across multiple subnets and in turn verify they are in place in the various monitoring, backup and maintenance systems.
Put together quickly and not currently follow best coding practices but will be refactored over time to be more portable and useable by third parties.

Documentation is lacking and will be added eventually time permitting.
